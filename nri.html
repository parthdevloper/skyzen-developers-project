    <h4><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> OTHER ISSUES</h4>
    <h6>Regarding rent out of the residential/commercial property purchased out of
      foreign exchange/rupee funds by NRI/PIO.</h6>

    <p> NRI/PIO can rent out the property without the approval of the RBI. Rent received can be credited to NRO/NRE
      account or remitted abroad. Powers have been delegated to the Authorised Dealers to allow repatriation of current
      income like rent, dividend, pension, interest, etc. of NRIs/PIO who do not maintain an NRO account in India based
      on an appropriate certification by a chartered accountant, certifying that the amount proposed to be remitted is
      eligible for remittance and that applicable taxes have been paid/provided for.</p>

    <p>The sale proceeds can be credited to NRO account.</p>

    <p>A person resident in India who is a citizen of Pakistan or Bangladesh or Sri Lanka or Afghanistan or China or
      Iran
      or Nepal or Bhutan is governed by the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management (Acquisition and Transfer of
      Immovable Property in India) Regulations, 2000. He would require prior approval of the RBI for acquisition and
      transfer of immovable property in India even though he is resident in India. Such requests are considered by the
      RBI in consultation with the Government in India.</p>
    <p>Foreign nationals of non-Indian origin resident outside India are not permitted to acquire any immovable property
      in India unless such property is acquired by way of inheritance from a person who was resident in India. However,
      they can acquire or transfer immovable property in India, on lease, not exceeding five years without the prior
      permission of the Reserve Bank.</p>

    <p>Foreign Nationals of non-Indian origin, other than a citizen of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan,
      China, Iran, Nepal or Bhutan, can acquire immovable property in India on becoming resident in India in terms of
      Section 2(v) of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999. In this connection, he has to satisfy the condition of
      period of stay. The type of visa granted should clearly indicate the intention to stay in India for an uncertain
      period to determine his residential status in terms of section 2(v) FEMA, 1999. (Press Release dated February 1,
      2009 issued by Government of India is enclosed as Annex-1).</p>

    <p>Foreign nationals of non-Indian origin who have acquired immovable property in India by way of inheritance with
      the specific approval of the Reserve Bank or have purchased the immovable property with the specific approval of
      the Reserve Bank cannot transfer such property without the prior permission of the Reserve Bank.</p>

    <p>The relevant regulations covering the transactions in immovable property have been notified vide RBI Notification
      No. FEMA 21/2000-RB dated May 3, 2000 and this basic notification has been subsequently amended by the
      notifications detailed below:</p>

    <p>ii) Notification No.FEMA 65/2002-RB dated June 29, 2002;</p>
    <p>iii) Notification No.FEMA 93/2003-RB dated June 9, 2003;</p>
    <p> iv) Notification No. FEMA 146/2006-RB dated February 10, 2006 read with A.P.(DIR Series) Circular No. 5 dated
      16.8.2006; and</p>
